# Telegram Bot: Income & Expense Manager

This repository contains a Telegram bot that allows users to record both **income** and **expenses** directly from their chat. The bot integrates with a Google Apps Script web app, sending transaction data to a spreadsheet in real time. This README provides an overview of the project logic, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Overview

This bot is designed to streamline the process of logging financial transactions by guiding the user step by step. Users can:

- Add **income** transactions with category, account, description, and amount.  
- Add **expense** transactions with category, account, description, amount, and optional date.  
- Interact using inline keyboards (for categories and accounts) or direct text input.

Once data is received, it‚Äôs sent to an Apps Script web endpoint (`YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL`) that appends the record to a Google Sheet.

## Features

- **Inline Keyboards**: The bot displays various categories (income or expense) and account types as clickable buttons.
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: After choosing the transaction type, the user is guided through category selection, account selection, description entry, and amount input.
- **Optional Date for Expenses**: Users can specify a date or type ‚Äútoday‚Äù to automatically use the current date.
- **Error Handling**: If a user provides invalid input (like non-numeric amounts), the bot sends an error message, preventing incomplete or incorrect records.
- **Flexible Integration**: Sensitive data (bot token and web app URL) is handled via environment variables for security.
